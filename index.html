To move the ship, the player must move laterally, and to shoot, they must scream into an iPhone. The way they shout alters the way their bullets appear and deal damage. The game uses these types of awkward, silly, over-the-top inputs as a catalyst for more expressive and liberating play. Shown at 2012 at Come Out And Play NYC.">

To move the ship, the player must move laterally, and to shoot, they must scream into an iPhone. The way they shout alters the way their bullets appear and deal damage. The game uses these types of awkward, silly, over-the-top inputs as a catalyst for more expressive and liberating play. Shown at 2012 at Come Out And Play NYC.">

Two players use PS3 controllers to navigate their gladiators around the playfield. The game is streamed to its own Twitch.tv channel, so people can view it from anywhere. By typing commands into the channelâ€™s chatroom, spectators can affect the playfield by spawning those items within the game world. Most items can be created by typing one word, but certain commands take a certain amount of discovery and collective effort, with plenty of room for mischief along the way.">

The player, naturally a purple star, is in a world of hostile pink and blue squares. They can press keys to pull their points in--a difficult balancing act--or attempt to achieve their goals while dodging aggression. Whichever way the player decides to play the game, they must work harder and feel more anxiety about their decisions than anyone else on the screen, just for looking different. LIMiNAL was made in 2011 and shown at Different Games 2013.">

My team's project addressed issues of contested space/conflicting interests in the area, as well as the prevalence of broken-down information interfaces. Through implicit (e.g. gestural/eye-tracking) and explicit (e.g. texting the system to notify concered parties) actions, our system uses public space and public data to encourage critical thinking and closing the loop between citizen concern and action.">
